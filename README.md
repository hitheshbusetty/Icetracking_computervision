in this project we explored the ways to findout boundaries between ice and bedrock using various algorithms

To understand how rising global temperatures affect ice at the Earth’s north and south poles, glaciologists need information about the structure of the ice sheets. The traditional way of doing this is to drill into the ice and remove an ice core. But a single ice core can take many months to drill, and only gives information about the ice at a single latitude-longitude point. To expedite this process, scientists have developed radar systems that allow an airplane to collect an approximate “cross section” of the ice below the airplane’s flight path (Fig 2a). This produces a radar echogram like the one shown in Fig 2b. The horizontal axis is the distance along the flight path, while the vertical axis is the depth below the plane. The echogram shows two prominent features. One is the very dark line near the top, which is the boundary between the air and the ice. There’s also a deeper line which shows the boundary between the ice and the bedrock. Fig 2c shows the same echogram but with the air-ice (red) and ice-rock (green) boundaries manually labeled. These echograms reveal the complex structure of the ice — note the ridges and valleys in the bedrock in Fig 2c, for example — and contain rich information for glaciologists to calculate volumes of ice and to estimate how it will change with warming temperatures. But as you can see from the figure, these echograms are also extremely noisy, so finding the layer boundaries is quite challenging. Even human experts, when presented with the same echogram, often disagree on where the boundaries are.


In this part, we’ll create code to try to find these two boundaries (air-ice and ice-rock). We’ll make some assumptions to make this possible. First, you can assume that the air-ice boundary is always above the ice-rock boundary by a significant margin (say, 10 pixels). Second, you can assume that the two boundaries span the entire width of the image. Taken together these, two assumptions mean that in each column of the image, there is exactly one air-ice boundary and exactly one ice-rock boundary, and the ice-rock boundary is always below. Third, we assume that each boundary is relatively “smooth” — that is, a boundary’s row in one column will be similar in the next column. Finally, you can assume that the pixels along the boundaries are generally dark and along a strong image edge (sharp change in pixel values).
